This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

---My Documentation Starts from here

1)\_Clerk-
It's amazing to learn how quickly and efficiently you can utilize the power of third party tool and make a form which can help in signing in and out using multiple platforms (like facebook, google, github, linkedin and a lot more).
Then once logged in, the information and power it provides, is quite astonishing for me as well. You can manage loggedin devices, update profile, set password, and a lot more.
Instead of focusing on implementing authentication and getting into a hell everytime, it has helped me to work briskly and swiftly and keep my focus on main things which I need to learn but again just like chatGPT, it's useful and worthy to play with as long as you have strong grisp on core concepts of authentication implementation like OAUTH, JWT, PassportJS and etc.

2)\_Shadcn-UI-
Such an amazing library to quickly work with the different components without taking the hell of managing each and everything from sratch.

3)\_SupaBase-
Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that provides developers with a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, storage, and serverless functions.

4)\_Prisma-
Helps us define the schema easily. Can switch to any sql database easily without the need to rewrite in that sql's particular syntax.
Generates different migrations(versions) of database.
a)\_Install prisma.
b)\_Write Schemas in schema.prisma file
c)\_Create PrismaClient in ./lib/prisma.js file
d)\_Create a migration of db

5)\_Arcjet-
Integrates with. Bot protection, data redaction, rate limiting, email validation & more in just a few lines of code. Customizable protection for forms, login pages, and API routes.

6)\_Inngest-
Inngest's durable functions replace queues, state management, and scheduling to enable developers to build reliable, AI-ready step functions faster â€” without touching infrastructure.
command used: "npx inngest-cli@latest dev"
